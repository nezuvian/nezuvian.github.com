I've decided to move my blog, from [my wp site](nezuvian.wordpress.com). I haven't really used that one, not really sure why. It's kinda hard to find interesting stuff and write about it :) Nevertheless I'm going to give it another try. Hopefully there will be a post about developing Symfony2 in SublimeText 2, I'm still testing things, but it's looking really good. 

P.S This blog is still under construction :)
